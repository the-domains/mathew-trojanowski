description: 'SpaceX has come a very long way. This company who just in the last few years has become a huge talking point with people in the space community. They have made huge progress in space travel and technology for today and the future. With the last few launches being a failure and a learning process for this U.S.A based company they have landed three rockets on a floating barge in the middle of the ocean which is the first ever done in history. Congrats SpaceX!'
